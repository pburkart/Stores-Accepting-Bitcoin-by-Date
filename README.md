## Contributing
Contributing to this repository is very easy and simply requires a little bit of patience and some time. If you know of a Business that is accepting bitcoin that isn't on the list, and you know the date of when they started accepting it, you can go ahead and add it to the list. If you don't know the date, go to Google and search for something like "Business Name now accepting Bitcoin" and look for news articles or forum posts announcing the business's intention to start accepting bitcoin. If you're interested in finding new businesses that are accepting Bitcoin, you can search on google for this in the same fashion.
